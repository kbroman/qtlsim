Version 0.73-2, 11/7/2011:

   Added NAMESPACE.


Version 0.72-1, 10/26/2009

   Fixed links in help files.

   In anal.leaps, calls to summary.regsubsets() replaced with just summary().


Version 0.71-7, 4/22/2009

   To get rid of a warning message in the latest version of R's
   package checks, changed the name of the functions convert.sim and
   convert.output to convertSim and convertOutput, respectively.


Version 0.71-6, 10/9/2007

   Fixed some slight problems in the help files.


Version 0.71-4, 10/16/2006

   Changed the name of the first argument in convert.sim and
   convert.output so that we don't get a warning message in R CMD
   check.


Version 0.71-3, 6/22/2003

   In calls to C code (using the .C() function), now make use of the
   PACKAGE argument.


Version 0.71-2, 6/4/2002

   The last column returned by which.correct() should be
   labelled "incor.unlinked" rather than "incor.total".  This is now
   fixed.

   Changed a call to error() to stop() in anal.leaps().  (There is no
   function error().)


Version 0.70-2, 11/19/2001

   Fixed a few minor problems in the help files.


Version 0.70, 11/3/2001

   Added forward selection following by backward elimination
   (method="forwback") to the function anal.leaps().


Version 0.69, 11/1/2001

   Edited the documentation files to make them more complete (and to
   remove a repeated typographical error that resulted in the
   descriptions of the arguments not appearing in the help files).

   Added a function convert.output() for converting the output of
   anal.leaps(), anal.mcmc() and perm() for use with which.correct().

   Fixed a bug in anal.leaps(): one line was hard-coded for exactly
   100 markers!


Version 0.68, 08/01/2001

   Revised anal.multi2() back, so that MCMC starts at the null model.


Version 0.67, 07/31/2001

    Revised anal.multi2() so that MCMC starts at the model chosen by
    forward selection with BIC, for the first of the bic_mult given.
    Revised sim.mcmc() so that one may choose to do only forward
    selection and MCMC.


Version 0.66, 07/26/2001

    The C function forw_perm() was clearly wrong.  I totally re-did it
    (thanks to advice from/discussion with Saunak Sen!)


Version 0.65, 07/26/2001

    There's a bug in anal.all() that causes a core dump.  It turned
    out to be the simple problem of having the max.steps argument
    larger than the total number of markers.


Version 0.64, 07/23/2001

    Added anal.multi2() to do everything anal.multi() does, plus run
    MCMC with BIC-delta.


Version 0.63, 07/17/2001

    Added plot.cor() function for plotting the output of
    which.correct().  Revised which.correct() so that the last
    column is the number of unlinked (rather than total) extraneous
    loci.


Version 0.62, 07/17/2001

    Added functions combine.sims() combine.mcmc() to combine the
    simulation results of multiple runs of anal.multi() or sim.mcmc(),
    respectively.


Version 0.61, 07/16/2001

    Revised which.correct() to give both the total number of
    extraneous loci and the number of extraneous loci on the same
    chromosome as a QTL.


Version 0.60, 07/14/2001

    Added function to call the "leaps" packages to use the
    branch-and-bound procedure, and ported my old MCMC code
    to do a simple MCMC model selection procedure


Version 0.56, 07/13/2001

    Revised "anal.multi" to contain default LOD thresholds that I
    estimated via (extensive) computer simulations.


Version 0.55, 07/12/2001

    Added "anal.multi" function to do repeated simulations + analysis
    by ANOVA, CIM, and forward selection with BIC and permutation
    tests.


Version 0.54, 07/10/2001

    Completed addition of analysis programs, including the "bump
    finding" function necessary for turning LOD curves from ANOVA/IM
    and CIM into a selected model.


Version 0.53, 07/09/2001

    Added analysis programs.


Version 0.51, 07/06/2001

    Implemented an old (1996) simulation program.  Why didn't I look
    for and reuse this code in the first place?


Version 0.50, 06/19/2001

    A new package; the aim is to test different model selection
    approaches to identifying QTLs in backcrosses, in the case of an
    additive model.
